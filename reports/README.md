## Usage Instructions

### 1. Set Execution Policy

PowerShell may restrict script execution by default. To allow the script to run, set the execution policy to `RemoteSigned` for the current user.
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
```

### 2. Run the Script with Admin Privileges

Execute the script with administrative privileges to ensure all sections have the necessary access.
```powershell
.\Security_Report_Generator.ps1
```

### 3. Review the Reports

Upon successful execution, a `Security_Report` folder will be created on your **Desktop** containing the following:

- **Critical Security Settings:**
  - `Windows_Defender_Status.txt`
  - `Firewall_Status.txt`
  - `UAC_Status.txt`
  - `Windows_Update_Status.txt`

- **Access Logs and Sessions:**
  - `Security_Logs.csv`
  - `RDP_Connections.csv`
  - `Active_Sessions.txt`
  - `Netstat_3389.txt`

- **Installed Software:**
  - `Installed_Remote_Software.csv`
  - `All_Installed_Applications.csv`

- **Network Security:**
  - `Established_Connections.txt`
  - `Recent_Logons.csv`

- **System Information:**
  - `System_Information.txt`

- **Additional Security Checks:**
  - `BitLocker_Status.txt`
  - `Scheduled_Tasks.csv`

- **Logs:**
  - `Report_Log.txt`
  - `Error_Log.csv`

### 4. Interpret the Report Summary

After execution, the script provides a **Report Summary** in the terminal indicating the status of each report file:

- **‚úÖ Successfully Created:** The report was generated without issues.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Created but Empty:** The report file exists but contains no data, indicating no relevant information was found.
- **‚ùå Encountered Errors:** The report generation failed. Refer to `Error_Log.csv` for detailed error messages.
- **‚ùì Status Unknown:** The report status could not be determined.

**Example Report Summary:**

```
üìÑ Report Summary:
Security_Logs.csv: ‚ùì Status Unknown - Security logon events have been successfully recorded.
Installed_Remote_Software.csv: ‚ö†Ô∏è Created but Empty - No known remote access software was found on the system.
Netstat_3389.txt: ‚ùì Status Unknown - No active RDP connections were found.
UAC_Status.txt: ‚úÖ Successfully Created - User Account Control is enabled.
BitLocker_Status.txt: ‚úÖ Successfully Created - BitLocker status has been successfully recorded.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Summary:** Some issues were detected during the report generation. Please review the Error_Log.csv for details and consider investigating the empty reports.

‚úÖ **Security report generated at C:\Users\lluin\Desktop\Security_Report**
‚ùó **Please check Error_Log.csv for any errors encountered during the report generation.**
```

### 5. Review Error Logs

Open `Error_Log.csv` within the `Security_Report` folder to investigate any errors that occurred during report generation. Each entry includes a timestamp, the associated file name, and a descriptive error message.

**Example Error Log:**

```csv
Timestamp,FileName,ErrorMessage
2024-10-16 12:00:40,RDP_Connections.csv,"No events were found that match the specified selection criteria."
2024-10-16 12:00:41,Installed_Remote_Software.csv,"No known remote access software found."
2024-10-16 12:01:03,Scheduled_Tasks.csv,"No scheduled tasks found."
```

   - **General Tab:**
     - **Name:** Security Report Generation
     - **Description:** Automatically generates a security report for Windows 11 systems.
     - **Security Options:** Select **"Run with highest privileges"**.

   - **Triggers Tab:**
     - Click **"New..."** and set the desired schedule (e.g., weekly on Mondays at 2 AM).

   - **Actions Tab:**
     - Click **"New..."** and configure:
       - **Action:** Start a program
       - **Program/script:** `powershell.exe`
       - **Add arguments:** `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Scripts\Security_Report_Generator.ps1"`

   - **Conditions and Settings Tabs:**
     - Adjust as needed (e.g., run only if connected to AC power).

4. **Save the Task:**

   - Click **"OK"** and provide administrative credentials if prompted.
